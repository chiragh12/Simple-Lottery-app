# Lottery App
This is a simple Flutter application that simulates a lottery app. It allows users to generate a random lottery number and check if they have won or lost.





## Getting Started
To run the app, you need to have Flutter installed on your system. If you haven't installed Flutter yet, you can follow the installation guide provided on the official Flutter website.

```
## Running App
Running the App
Once you have Flutter installed and the repository cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command:
```

```
This will launch the app on the connected device or emulator.
## How the App work
The app is a simple lottery game with a fixed winning number (4). The main screen of the app displays a text message stating the winning number.

Below the text, there is a container that shows whether the user has won or lost the lottery. The container displays a success message with a green checkmark icon if the user's lottery number matches the winning number. Otherwise, it shows an error message with a red error icon and informs the user of their generated lottery number.

The user can generate a new lottery number by tapping the floating action button (FAB) with the refresh icon. The new number is randomly generated using the dart:math library.
